        <h2>🎤 Event Crew</h2>
        <p>
          Joining WHX Event, CyberDSA, and DronTech was such a fun and eye-opening experience.
          It was my first time being part of large-scale events, and everything felt exciting
          from busy halls to impressive booths and new technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          At WHX Event, I helped with event support and interacted with visitors, which boosted
          my confidence and communication skills. CyberDSA felt energetic and fast-paced,
          teaching me how important teamwork and quick thinking are in a real working environment.
          Meanwhile, DronTech was especially interesting as I got to see innovative technologies
          up close while working together with my team to keep everything running smoothly.

        <h2>🏃 Crew Marathon</h2>
        <p>
          Being part of the event crew for Malaysia Vibes Fest (Half Marathon) and BMW Charity Run
          was a fun, energetic, and unforgettable experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a crew member, I assisted with runner registration, crowd coordination,
          and on-ground support to ensure the events ran smoothly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the long hours, the positive energy from runners and fellow crew members
          made everything worthwhile. These experiences strengthened my teamwork,
          responsibility, and time management skills.

        <h2>🛒 Promo Work</h2>
        <p>
          Working as a promo crew for HL Milk and Nuuna Noodles was a fun and hands-on experience.
          From product sampling to interacting with customers, every shift was filled with smiles,
          conversations, and a bit of multitasking.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned how to approach customers confidently, explain products clearly,
          and handle different personalities in a friendly way. Communication and teamwork
          played a big role in making each promotion successful.
